# Final Project Milestone 3
### Title: Team Theta
### Subtitle: Teammaker
### Semester: Spring 2020

#### Overview
We plan to develop a website that users can find teammates for their classes. For example, they can post messages like they are looking for teammates for CS 383 section B, and post their phone numbers, class's syllabus, professors' names, TAs' names, and probably link to that class in [ratemyprofessor.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/), and they may also mention some requirements for their expected classmates (proficient in Python, know SQL, etc). Our purpose is that since many classes have a term project, they probably need some teammates to cooperate with. We give them chances to invite people that have not yet enroll in these classes or already enrolled in these classes but do know them. Also, some classes might be too challenging, and this app can let users find classmates and solve problems together. Our website does not relate to an existing application.

#### APIs
**Requests:**

Our Web API is based on **REST** principles. Data resources are accessed via standard HTTPS requests in UTF-8 format to an API endpoint.

| METHOD | ACTION              |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| GET    | Retrieve a resource |
| POST   | Create a resource   |
| PUT    | Update a resource   |
| DELETE | Deletes a resource  |

**Example requests and responses for our application API:**

1. Users can create account with an email address, and he has to select one university in the process to match the corresponding posts.

   | Resource | Request verb | Description                                                  | status code                                            |
   | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
   | /create  | POST         | Creates an account for a user(email required and university required),parameter is the email of user | 200:OK                                                 |
   | /create? | PUT          | Verifies user's email address                                | 200:ok/400:"email not exist" or "email already exists" |
   | /user?   | POST         | sends verification email to the user                         | 200:ok/400:"could not find","already have verified"    |

1. In dashboard, users will see a list of posts that posted by other users, and they may also search for posts they looking for by typing post name, teammates name, or post ID via search bar. When users click on one post, a window will appear the detail of this post which contains all details about this post, and there would be a field to leave comments, and a button for requesting into this team.

- The request to join would notify team leader who created the post. Team leader can approve or reject the request in the notification.
- Users may leave comments under each post. Also, the comments will notify to all teammates in this post. When the teammate clicks the notification, the browser will jump to this post and he can reply to it.

#### Database Description
A final up-to-date representation of your database including a brief description of each of the entities in your data model and their relationships if any.

|Jiawei Qi       |Documentation and structure, Implement API documentation, Implement Resting API(wish list,post, and comment ) function, Backend Functionality of  post(CREATE, DELETE,GET,PUT), comment(CREATE,DELETE,GET,PUT), and wish list(PUT,DELETE)|
|Jiaming Yuan    |Designed and implemented general layout of index.html, create.html, profile.html, and post.html using Bootstrap.

Designed structure of documents in MongoDB and implemented model schema in src/model folder. Implemented post method for "register account" function in server.js. |
|Donglin Zhang   |Web page design and documentation fix, Build server, implement "login" function, deploy on Heroku|

#### Conclusion



First barrier we met is to find a suitable topic for this project. We came up with few cool ideas, but all shut down by every reasons: That's actually make us feel pretty stressed and disappointed. For milestone1, Web design is literally a tricky part, we use the knowledge of what we learnt about CSS ,HTML, and Javascript to finish this task. And then when it comes to milestone2, frontend, we did a lot of research and necessary study about APIs, how to build a server, connect to the MongoDB, and Deployment on Heroku. These tasks are actually challenging and complicated, We're really glad for ourselves to the result: we got through these challenges and did a very good job about UI and Frontend. For the last part, we successfully implemented the structure of database, and finished the operations on the Database, and Implement all necessary logic of your server to connect up your data model with the user interface to make sure our project works: milestone3 is pretty hard, cause we have to make sure we understand the structure of database, and test it to make sure it works. then we need to make sure the function of backend successful works with UI.
